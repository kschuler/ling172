# ling172

Course website for ling172/psyc215: Data Science for studying language and the mind.

## Editing

### `index.md`

The website is created with two files: `_config.yml` and `index.md`. Edits should be made to `index.md` only. The simplest way to make changes is right in the github GUI. 

### Adding links to course materials

Add links to course materials (e.g. colab notebooks, google slides, etc) to the schedule portion of the course website. Make sure the notebooks are viewable, but not editable by anyone with the link. 

## Website

The website renders here, and is updated after each commit: [https://kathrynschuler.com/ling172](https://kathrynschuler.com/ling172)
