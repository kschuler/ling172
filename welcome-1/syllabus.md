## Overview

### Course description

Welcome to Data Science for studying Language and the Mind! Data Sci for Lang & Mind is an entry-level course designed to teach basic principles of data science to students with little or no background in statistics or computer science. Students will learn to identify patterns in data using visualizations and descriptive statistics; make predictions from data using machine learning and optimization; and quantify the certainty of their predictions using statistical models. This course aims to help students build a foundation of critical thinking and computational skills that will allow them to work with data in all fields related to the study of the mind \(e.g. linguistics, psychology, philosophy, cognitive science, neuroscience\).

_This is an introductory course and no specific background is assumed or required. Freshmen are very welcome!_

### General Schedule

All class sessions will be 60 minutes unless otherwise noted. See what we've got planned for each class session each week on the full [Schedule](schedule.md).

* **Online textbook** \(free\): R for Data Science by X, Y, and Z
* **Discussion board**: for questions and discussions

### Evaluation

* **Exams \(90%\):** There are four take-home "exams", but the lowest exam score is dropped
* **Data journal \(10%\)**: Practice your skills by applying what you’ve learned to \(at least\) four data

  sets of your choosing. More details will be provided on the course website.

* Note that **lab problem sets are ungraded**. They are designed to help you practice your new skills in a low-pressure environment and to help you prepare for the exams!

## FAQs

**Can I skip the fourth exam if I am happy with my grade on the first three?**

> Yes! You can skip the fourth exam and it will be dropped. Your grade will be based on the first three exams.

**If I miss lab can I come to another lab section that week?**

> Sure! You can join any lab session that will work for your schedule. But keep in mind that the rooms are small so it’s best to email the section TA to let them know.

**I noticed a mistake in the grading of my exam. How do I get this fixed?**

> We will look at your exam again if you make a formal [re-grade request](https://canvas.upenn.edu/courses/1489351/modules/items/17298855) via Canvas within one week of getting your exam back.

**I missed or failed an exam. What can I do to make it up?**

> Nothing. We don’t allow make-up exams or retakes. However, we drop your lowest exam score, so you can still do well in the class. Just make sure it doesn’t happen more than once!

**Can I turn in my data journal late?**

> Yep! Data journals will be accepted without penalty through the end of the semester \(Dec 10th\).

**I missed class, how can I catch up?**
